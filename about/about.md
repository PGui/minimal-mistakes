Hey,

I'm Guillaume, a french programmer at [Dontnod Entertainment](http://dont-nod.com/) which is very known for ***Life Is Strange*** and also ***Remember Me***.  
I'm currently working on ***Vampyr*** ðŸ§› and on some very secret projects.

I went to the **University Institute of Technology** of *Aix-en-Provence, France*, where I got a degree in computer science.

After that, I integrated in 2012 **CrÃ©ajeux**, a video game school in *NÃ®mes, France*. It was my first contact with what it really means to make video games and work with a team.

Finally, I went to the **National Graduate School of Games** ([ENJMIN](http://www.enjmin.fr/)) in *AngoulÃªme, France*. That's where I made awesome projects with awesome people. I learned to work with every profession requiered to make a game (artists, game designers, sound designers, producers, programmers, ergonomists) and widely improved my skills. I got my Master degree from the ENJMIN in 2016.
