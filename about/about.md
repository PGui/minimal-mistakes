Hey,
{: .text-justify}
I'm Guillaume, a programmer at [Dontnod Entertainment](http://dont-nod.com/). Part of a cross project team, I work/worked on ***Vampyr***, ***The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit***, ***Life is Strange 2*** and other unannounced projects.
{: .text-justify}
I am making, extending, maintaining many tools for Unreal Engine 4 as well as proprietary tools used by Dontnod's development teams such as:

* Data Mining system.
* *Google Maps* like levels display.
* Maya and Motionbuilder Animation Pipeline. Tooling and communication with Unreal Engine.
* 3DS Max/Maya/Unreal Engine Asset Pipeline.

But I also have strong interest in gameplay programming and gamer feel, I occasionally do game jams with my friends.

On my spare time, I love to hangout, play narrative games and watch movies/TV shows.
