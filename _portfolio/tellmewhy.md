## What I did on this project

{: .text-justify}
For this project, we decided to change the animation pipeline and use Maya instead of Motionbuilder because it offered more advantages.
So, we ported everything [I did](https://guillaumepastor.com/portfolio/captainspirit/#what-i-did-on-this-project) to Maya and provided a new set of tools for the animators to work in the best possible conditions.

{: .text-justify}
I also work on one major step to improve the Dontnod's asset pipeline : **GAIA** aka **"The Derusher"**.

{: .text-justify}
**"The Derusher"** aims to provide a user friendly way to list and create assets within the engine with their sources (meshes, textures, materials) with the right naming and the right location using **3DSMax**, **Maya**, **Unreal Engine Python**. The goal is to prevent errors from artists when creating and naming assets in the editor and have a better control on how are created these assets.

{: .text-justify}
In fact were was different derushers, one for each job category:

* **Props Derusher** : List the meshes needed for the game and create the uassets (Static/Skeletal Meshes, Materials, Textures) and the associated source files within perforce (.max, .ma, .fbx, .png, .psd, .sbs...)
* **Characters Derusher** : Exactly like the Props derusher but taking into account some character department specificities
* **Animation Derusher** : Retrieve assets from the Props and the Character Derushers to create working scenes for the animators
