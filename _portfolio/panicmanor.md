Panic Manor üò± is a first person asymmetric multiplayer survival horror designed by Fr√©d√©rick Raynal (famous designer of Alone in the Dark, Little Big Adventure...). This project is a final year study project of Cr√©ajeux made with Unity3D.  
We were a team of about thirty students (yes that's a lot), part programmers and part artists and we had two full-time months to make this project.

In a proceduraly generated manor, you can either be the *Strangler*, the psychopath embodied by only one player, or one of the *students*, victims of the *Strangler* (up to nine players).
The game is played in two phases:
{: .text-justify}
* In the first one, the *students*, who can't face directly the *Strangler*, must gather and unite their forces to defeat him by throwing all kinds of objects found in the Manor.  
The *Strangler*, on the other hand, must isolate the poor *students* in order to, well..., strangle them.  
If the *Strangler* kills all his victims he wins and the game is over, if the *students* manage to kill him, the second phase starts.
* In the second phase, the **Manor's key** drop from the *Strangler*'s body.  
The remaining *students* must fight each other to get this key. The first one who reaches the gates of the Manor with the key will be the winner.

## What I did on this project

I mainly took care of the 3C programming; the character movements, their game states, the camera behavior and the interactions.  
I also was responsible of the animation integration and their network synchronisation.
