## What I did on this project

This project was made by 6 persons with Unity 3D in three months. Due to the small team, I had the chance to be in charge of many aspects of the game:
{: .text-justify}
* **gameplay** programming - movements, shoots, robot shields, game modes...
* a level editor **tool** for the designers
* coding the menus and the user interface
* integration of the models and the animations of the robots
* integration of some visual effetcs
